These are my configuration files for vim, bash, etc. 
Fork 'em, use 'em, whatever way you like.

You will require Armin Ronacher's vcprompt branch from 
https://bitbucket.org/mitsuhiko/vcprompt if you want the 
DVCS aware promt(works for git, hg, cvs and svn)


THANK YOU
- Bram Moolenaar for Vim itself
- Armin Ronacher(originally forked from github.com/mitsuhiko/dotfiles)
